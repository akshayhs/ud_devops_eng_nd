## Project 1: Deploy a static website on AWS

In this project, students are expected to deploy an instructor-supplied static website on AWS and setup content distribution using AWS CloudFront.

Access to project files [here](https://github.com/akshayhs/udacity_cloud_devops_nd/tree/master/1%20-%20Deploy%20Static%20Website%20on%20AWS).

### Cloud services used

- Amazon Web Services/AWS.

- AWS Simple Storage Service/S3.

- AWS Identity and Access Management/IAM.

- AWS CloudWatch for performance and health checks.

## Project 2: Deploy a high-availability web application using CloudFormation

Access project files [here](https://github.com/akshayhs/udacity_cloud_devops_nd/tree/master/2%20-%20Deploy%20a%20high%20scalability%20web%20app%20using%20CloudFormation).

In this project, students are expected to deploy web servers for an instructor-supplied web application to achieve high scalability using infrastructure provisioning tool, AWS CloudFormation.

### Tasks

1. Develop a cloud diagram using any websites such as Lucidchart or Diagrams as a reference/visual aid to help write the CloudFormation script.

2. Interpret the instructions from the cloud diagram and create a matching CloudFormation script.

3. Get access to the S3 bucket containing the web application files using AWS Identity and Access Management/IAM and deploy it on our private clouds in an automated fashion.

4. Discard the provisioned infrastructure using command-line tools once the web application is verified to be viewable by anyone with the given link, in an automated fashion.

## Project 3: Build a Jenkins pipeline for AWS

**Note: _This project was submitted in the form of screenshots for proof of its functioning and as such files are unavailable_.**

In this project, a student must deploy his/her own web site on AWS by building a multi-stage pipeline, of which one must be a step for linting, using Jenkins for CI/CD.

### Tools

- Tidy HTML linter.

- Latest version of Jenkins.

- AWS Identity and Access Management/IAM

- AWS Elastic Compute Cloud/EC2.

- AWS Simple Storage Service/S3.

- GitHub for version control.

## Project 4: Operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API and deploy to Kubernetes

In this project, students must containerize an instructor-supplied SciKit learn Machine-learning model that predics housing prices in Boston, using Docker, Kubernetes and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service/EKS.

Access project files [here](https://github.com/akshayhs/udacity_cloud_devops_nd/tree/master/4%20-%20Operationalize%20a%20Machine%20learning%20Microservice%20API).

### Tools and cloud services used

- Docker, Dockerhub for docker repository, Kubernetes(Minikube)

- GitHub for version control.

## Capstone project: Containerize a simple web application and deploy to EKS

In this project, students are tasked to propose their own scope of the project by including the following tools:

1. Amazon Web Services/AWS and its various services.

2. Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery.

3. Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

4. CircleCI for deployments.
